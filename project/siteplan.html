  <h1>CarMatch – Site Plan</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Site Name</h2>
    <p><strong>CarMatch</strong></p>
    <p>
      I chose CarMatch because the website helps users
      match with the best car for their needs. It can compare 
      different new and used vehicles to help find the best match.
    </p>

      The purpose of the site is to help people compare cars
      by viewing prices, features, and specifications. The site is
      intended to help users make informed decisions before buying a car.

    <p><strong>Mobile View:</strong></p>
    <p>
      The mobile layout will use a single column design. The header will
      appear at the top, followed by car comparison content stacked
      vertically.

    <p>
      The desktop layout will include a wider header and horizontal
      navigation. Car comparisons will be displayed side by side using
